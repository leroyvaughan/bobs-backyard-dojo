NOTES:
	- dynamic generation of dates via an input month/year
			> caveat: validation of algorithm for edge cases (leap year, year changes, [etc?])
			> caveat: first and last day of week algorithm

	- beginning of week starts on Sunday (because I said so)

	- splitting logic of date checking
			> helpers.isValidDateArray: only checks for length of array
			> actual functions { chargeOneDay, chargeOneWeek, chargeOneMonth }: will check date validity

	- (Use Case Rules Validation): isValidMonth vs. isSameMonth in dataChecks
			> sameMonth can return true on 10/36/2020
			> validMonth will return false
